#### The HALSplainer: Epicodus Week 3 Independent Project

### A simple interactive program/game by Marguerite Kennedy, April 12, 2019. 

## Description

"HAL," the not-so-benevolent computer overlord from a movie that at the advice of our lawyers we'll just call "Two Thousand Fun: A Copyright Infringement Odessey" asks the user to enter a number. HAL then "computersplains" the meaning of that number in a string of *seeming* nonsense that follows very specific rules. 

Starting at 0, HAL will give a list of the numbers up to and including the user's number. 
Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."


## Specs

The above exceptions are written from least to most important.

My strategy:

- First, take the user-entered value and loop up to the value of the entered number, from zero. 
- Loop through array using "to String" to evaluate each number at a given index. 
- If that number contains 3, replace with "I'm sorry,  Dave, I can't do that."
- if it contains 2 ==> "Boop!", 
  if 1 ==> "Beep!",
- if there's no 1, 2, or 3 in the number, then     
  display the number at that index with no replacement.
- Return the "translated" numbers to user.
